            <br>
            plant. The species originated in western South America and Central America. The Nahuatl (Aztec) word tomatl
            <br>
            gave rise to the Spanish word tomate, from which the English word tomato derived. The tomato is consumed in
            <br>
            diverse ways, including raw, as an ingredient in many dishes, sauces, salads, and drinks. It is used in many
            <br>
            cuisines, including Italian, Mexican, Indian, and Thai. Tomato is the leading vegetable consumed in the <br>
            United States. Tomato is a member of the nightshade family, Solanaceae. The species originated in the <br>

            the plant itself, a perennial in the family Solanaceae. The word "potato" may refer either to the plant<br>
            itself or to the edible tuber. In the Andes, where the species is indigenous, there are some other
            closely<br>
            related cultivated potato species. Potatoes were introduced to Europe in the second half of the 16th
            century<br>
            by the Spanish. It is the world's fourth-largest food crop, following maize, wheat, and rice. Potato is
            the<br>
            leading vegetable consumed in the United States. Potato is a member of the nightshade family,

            Onion
        </h4>

        <p>
            The onion, also known as the bulb onion or common onion, is a vegetable that is the most widely
            cultivated<br>
            species of the genus Allium. This genus also contains several other species variously referred to as
            onions<br>
            and cultivated for food, such as the Japanese bunching onion, the Canada onion, and the Japanese onion.
            The<br>
            name "wild onion" is applied to a number of Allium species and their cultivars, which are sometimes<br>
            mistakenly called wild onions. The onion is most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant, but is
            usually<br>
            treated as an annual. The onion plant has a fan of hollow, bluish-green leaves and its bulb at the base
            of<br>
            the plant begins to swell when a certain day-length is reached. The bulbs are composed of shortened,<br>
            compressed, underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale that envelop a central bud at the tip
            of<br>
            the stem. The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage. The onion is
            native<br>
            to Central Asia and northeastern Africa and has long been a widespread food in both temperate and
            tropical<br>
            regions. It was originally domesticated in prehistoric times. The onion plant has a fan of hollow,<br>
